Take photo and location of parking spot

To all the lost souls out there who can never remember where they parked their car,
this app will help them remember.

What to expect:
1. Take a photo of your parking spot
2. Save GPS location of your parking spot
3. Take a "Bird's Eye" navigation (navigation for dummies)
4. Use some external vehcile database API to get user's own car "default" looks
